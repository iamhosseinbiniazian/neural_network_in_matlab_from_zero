# neural network with matlab from zero


This is the MNIST image classification neural network has been implemented with GUI mode in matlab .in this project I used mnist dataset and the file of this dataset is exist in the repository as well as I used multi layer perceptron(MLP) neural network for classification features of data and it has been implemented in matlab and without any kind of helper library, also many of basic terms in neural nework such as activation function, backpropagation and etc they have been impelemented in this project.
